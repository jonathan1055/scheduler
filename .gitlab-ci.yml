# DrupalCI GitLabCI template
#
# Gitlab-ci.yml to replicate DrupalCI testing for Contrib
#
# With thanks to:
#   * The GitLab Acceleration Initiative participants
#   * DrupalSpoons
################

################
# Guidelines
#
# This template is designed to give any Contrib maintainer everything they need to test, without requiring modification.
# It is also designed to keep up to date with Core Development automatically through the use of include files that can
# be centrally maintained.
#
# However, you can modify this template if you have additional needs for your project.
################

################
# Includes
#
# Additional configuration can be provided through includes.
# One advantage of include files is that if they are updated upstream, the changes affect all pipelines using that include.
#
# Includes can be overridden by re-declaring anything provided in an include, here in gitlab-ci.yml
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/includes.html#override-included-configuration-values
################

include:
  ################
  # DrupalCI includes:
  # As long as you include this, any future includes added by the Drupal Association will be accessible to your pipelines automatically.
  # View these include files at https://git.drupalcode.org/project/gitlab_templates/
